TornadoCats is a project built for the Aleph Verano Hackathon. It provides a simple and efficient way to create wrapped tokens with homomorphic encryption, leveraging Zama's technology. The project is structured as a monorepo, consisting of a SvelteKit front-end and a folder containing all smart contracts.
